# Welcome to the Weather app

## This app allows you to view the current weather and forecast for a specific location. 
 It displays: 
- temperature 
- wind speed 
- humidity 
- visibility for that location.
#

To use the app, simply follow these steps:

- Open the app in your web browser
- Enter the city you want to view the weather for
- Press the "Submit" button to see the current weather for that location
#
The app is built using 
- React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
- TypeScript, a strongly-typed variant of JavaScript. 
- We have also utilized npm packages and the API provided by api.openweathermap.org to retrieve weather data.

## 



We hope you enjoy using our weather app!
